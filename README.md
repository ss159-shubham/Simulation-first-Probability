# Simulation-First Probability
### Overview
**Simulation-First Probability** is a structured, code-driven exploration of probability built from the ground up using simulation instead of formula memorization.    
This repository does not teach probability as abstract mathematics.    
It builds a probabilistic world — one that models randomness, variance, drawdowns, regime shifts, and perception distortions through Monte Carlo experiments.    
The goal is not to produce trading strategies.   
The goal is to understand the environment in which any probabilistic system must operate.

### Core Philosophy

Most people learn probability in this order:

1. Learn formulas
2. Apply to toy problems
3. Encounter real uncertainty
4. Misinterpret outcomes

This project inverts that order.    
We start by simulating full outcome distributions and observing behavior directly.    
If you cannot simulate it, you do not understand it.

### What This Project Is

- A simulation-based probability curriculum
- A Monte Carlo laboratory
- A structured exploration of randomness
- A foundation for decision-making under uncertainty
- A world-first framework (system-agnostic)

---
### What This Project Is NOT

- Not a trading strategy repository
- Not a backtesting framework
- Not an optimization guide
- Not financial advice
- Not a machine learning project
- No strategy construction exists in this repository.

Systems are secondary objects.   
Probability is the primary environment.

## Curriculum Structure
The repository is divided into modules. Each module builds one structural dimension of the probabilistic world.   

#### Module 0 — The Nature of Randomness (Conceptual Foundation)

- What randomness actually means
- Why humans misperceive randomness
- Why streaks feel “wrong.”
- Why intuition fails without simulation

No code. Conceptual grounding only.

#### Module 1 — Randomness & Streaks

- Simulating fair processes
- Distribution of streak lengths
- Why clustering is normal
- Why randomness does not look balanced

Outcome: Internalize that streaks are inevitable, not evidence.

#### Module 2 — Expectancy vs Outcomes

- Positive expectancy processes
- Finite sample distortion
- Endpoint dispersion
- Why good systems lose money temporarily

Outcome: Separate long-run edge from short-run experience.

#### Module 3 — Variance & Drawdowns

- Equity path simulation
- Distribution of drawdowns
- Losing streak depth and duration
- Psychological vs statistical pain

Outcome: Understand how bad things can get even when nothing is wrong.

#### Module 4 — Ruin & Survival

- Risk of ruin
- Capital constraints
- Position sizing implications
- Survival under variance

Outcome: Accept that survival is a mathematical constraint, not optimism.

#### Module 5 — Non-Stationarity

- Drifting expectancy
- Regime shifts
- Volatility regime changes
- Detection difficulty

Outcome: Understand that the world itself can change — slowly or abruptly — and that detecting change is noisy and delayed.

#### Module 6 — Aggregation & Time Compression

- Sampling frequency effects
- Rolling window instability
- Path vs endpoint illusion
- Volatility scaling

Outcome: Understand how measurement and time horizon distort perception.

### What You Will Gain

By completing all modules, you should:

- Stop being surprised by normal probabilistic outcomes
- Understand the full envelope of expected behavior
- Recognize variance vs structural change
- Understand why small samples mislead
- Understand how aggregation hides turbulence
- Evaluate probabilistic systems without emotional overreaction

You will not gain a strategy.

You will gain a stable probabilistic worldview.

### Design Principles

- Simulation over closed-form solutions
- Visualization over algebraic abstraction
- Interpretation over optimization
- Separation of world and system
- Constraint awareness before performance focus

Each notebook includes:

- Explicit simulation
- Visualization
- Interpretation
- Completion criteria

Intended Audience

---
### This repository is for:

- Traders who want probabilistic discipline
- Decision-makers operating under uncertainty
- Engineers interested in stochastic systems
- Anyone who wants deep intuition instead of surface formulas

It is not designed for exam preparation.

---
### How to Use This Repository

1. Complete modules sequentially.
2. Do not skip interpretation sections.
3. Do not modify simulations to “improve performance.”
4. Resist the urge to design systems during the curriculum.
5. Treat each module as self-contained.

This project is layered intentionally. Do not rush it.

---
### Why This Matters

Most failures in probabilistic systems come from:

- Misinterpreting variance
- Overreacting to streaks
- Underestimating drawdowns
- Confusing regime shifts with noise
- Evaluating performance at the wrong horizon

This repository exists to eliminate those blind spots.

---
### After Completing This Curriculum

Only after building the full probabilistic world should system design begin.

System design belongs in a separate project.

Probability defines the environment.   
Systems must survive inside it.
