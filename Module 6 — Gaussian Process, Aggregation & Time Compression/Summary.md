# Module 6 — Summary

Module 6 transitions from discrete Bernoulli modeling to continuous Gaussian return modeling.

The focus is not realism, but structural understanding.

Key findings:

- Aggregation rescales volatility but does not alter expectancy.
- Rolling estimates are unstable at small sample sizes due to estimator variance.
- Drawdown perception changes with evaluation frequency.
- Square-root-of-time volatility scaling holds only under IID assumptions.
- Volatility clustering breaks predictable scaling.

The central insight:

Timeframe does not determine edge.
Signal-to-noise ratio does.

Apparent regime shifts, instability, and risk differences across horizons often emerge from sampling mechanics rather than structural change.

Understanding these statistical foundations prevents overreaction,     
misinterpretation of rolling performance,      
and improper volatility scaling.
