# What Module 1 *Really* Does
## Module 1 establishes the baseline of normality in a random world.
*Not fairness*  
*Not expected outcomes*  
*Not average behaviour*   

But the full envelope of what can naturally happen when:
- probabilities are fixed
- The system is unbiased
- nothing is "wrong."

In other words:
  **Module 1 answers**: *"What outcomes are still normal, even when everything is fair?"*

# Why this baseline matters
Before Module 1, most people implicitly believe:
- “If things get bad, something must be broken.”
- “Long streaks mean conditions changed.”
- “Extreme paths imply unfairness.”
- “Pain is evidence.”
Module 1 dismantles that.

After Module 1, the correct baseline becomes:
- Deep drawdowns can be normal
- Brutal streaks can be normal
- Clustering can be normal
- Divergent lives can be normal
- Emotional stress can be normal

**Normal does not mean pleasant.**     
**Normal does not mean frequent.**      
**Normal means allowed by the system.**
