    "# Observation\n",
    "### Streaks that feel impossible at the individual level occur reliably in large random samples. Although the probability of an extreme streak at any specific moment is low, the accumulation of trials makes such streaks inevitable. Their occurrence does not signal a broken process, only sufficient sample size. Even in relatively small samples (e.g., 100 trials), extreme-looking streaks such as 7 or more consecutive identical outcomes can occur naturally in fair random processes. These streaks do not require large sample sizes to emerge; they arise because each trial creates a new opportunity for a run to begin. As the number of trials increases, the probability that at least one such streak appears approaches certainty. Therefore, the presence of long streaks is not evidence of bias, failure, or structural change, but an expected feature of randomness when viewed across time."
