# Module 2 — Expectancy vs Outcomes
### Purpose of Module 2
Module 2 investigates the gap between mathematical expectancy and lived outcomes in probabilistic systems. Its purpose is to dismantle the intuitive but false belief that a positive edge should produce smooth, reliable, and emotionally reassuring results in real time.

This module focuses on experience, not optimization. It does not evaluate trading strategies, improve performance, or analyze real market data. Instead, it uses controlled simulations to expose how randomness, variance, and time interact with expectancy to shape what participants actually live through.

### Core Questions This Module Answers
- Why do winning systems often feel broken?
- Why can two identical systems produce vastly different lived experiences?
- Why do losing periods persist inside positive expectancy processes?
- Why does short-term feedback mislead judgment?
- Why does emotional discomfort dominate even when math is favorable?

---
### Methodology
All experiments in this module follow these constraints:

- Synthetic, simulated data only
- Fixed probabilities and bounded outcomes
- No strategy logic, optimization, or hindsight
- Repeated runs and distributional analysis
- Emphasis on paths, drawdowns, and time spent in pain

The simulations are intentionally simple so that all observed complexity arises from probability itself, not from model sophistication.

### Module Structure

2.1 — What “Positive Expectancy” Actually Means (and Doesn’t)   
Separates population-level expectancy from individual paths.

2.2 — Same Expectancy, Wildly Different Lives    
Shows how identical systems create unequal experiences across agents.

2.3 — Losing Periods Inside Winning Systems      
Demonstrates that losing windows are structural, not anomalous.

2.4 — Probability of Loss Over Finite Horizons     
Quantifies how long positive EV takes to dominate outcomes.

2.5 — Why Short Samples Lie     
Explains why early feedback is noisy, extreme, and misleading.

2.6 — Outcome Dispersion Across Time, Not Just Across Traders    
Reveals how the same system looks “great” or “terrible” depending on the time slice.

2.7 — Mathematical Expectancy vs Lived Experience     
Contrasts a discrete reward with a continuous psychological cost.

### What This Module Is Not
- It is not a trading guide
- It does not validate or invalidate any strategy
- It does not reduce risk or increase returns
- It does not eliminate drawdowns

Its goal is calibration, not comfort.

### Intended Outcome

By the end of Module 2, the learner should no longer ask:
> “Is something wrong with my system?”    

But instead ask:   
> “Is this outcome consistent with probabilistic reality?”
