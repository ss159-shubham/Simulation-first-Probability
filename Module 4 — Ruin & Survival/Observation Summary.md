# Module 4 — Summary
#### Ruin & Survival

Module 4 reframes how trading systems should be evaluated.

Across multiple simulations, the focus shifts from surface-level metrics like win rate and average return toward deeper structural realities: expectancy, variance, leverage sensitivity, and survival probability.

A central realization emerges early:
Win rate and payoff ratio are interchangeable components of expectancy. Different combinations can produce identical mathematical edge. Accuracy alone does not determine profitability, 
nor does a low win rate imply fragility.

However, once leverage is introduced, the picture changes.

Expectancy determines long-term drift, but variance determines dispersion. Leverage amplifies variance. When risk per trade increases, 
systems with identical expectancies begin to behave very differently. Some remain structurally stable. Others become fragile. 
The divergence is not caused by edge — it is caused by how variance interacts with position sizing.

The simulations reveal several important patterns:

- Ruin often clusters early rather than gradually.
- Survivors are frequently statistical outliers.
- Mean final returns can be heavily distorted by rare extreme winners.
- Median outcomes better represent the typical lived experience.
- Survival probability determines who actually participates in expectancy.

Systems with identical positive expectancy can produce dramatically different ruin rates and median outcomes when their payoff structures differ. 
The most exciting systems — those with large right tails — often have lower survival probabilities. A high mean return does not guarantee a high typical outcome.

The module ultimately replaces performance obsession with structural thinking.

Instead of asking:

- “How much can this system make?”

The more important questions become:

- “How sensitive is this to leverage?”
- “What is the probability of extinction?”
- “What does the median trader experience?”
- “Can this survive variance long enough for edge to matter?”

The core hierarchy established is:

Expectancy → Variance → Leverage → Survival → Lived Outcome

Positive expectancy is necessary.      
But survival is mandatory.     

Module 4 concludes with a shift in evaluation criteria: systems should not be judged primarily by upside potential or average return, but by robustness under stress and durability across time.

In short:

*Edge determines possibility.*    
*Variance determines reality.*    
*Leverage determines fragility.*    
*Survival determines who wins.*
