# Module 4 — Ruin & Survival
### Module Purpose
Module 4 investigates how positive expectancy interacts with variance and leverage to produce radically different survival outcomes.

> If a system has edge, under what conditions does a trader still fail?
   
The goal is to move from theoretical profitability to structural robustness.

---
This module sits at the transition point between:    
- Edge discovery
and
- Risk realism

Module 4 introduces:
- Time-to-ruin analysis
- Survival probability
- Median vs mean distortion
- Variance sensitivity under leverage
- Psychological acceptance of fragility

This module marks the shift from “Can it work?” to “Can it survive?”

## Learning Objectives
By completing this module, the reader should be able to:

- Distinguish expectancy from survival probability.
- Understand how variance structure affects ruin risk.
- Recognize why mean return is often misleading.
- Interpret median outcomes as representative experience.
- Quantify how leverage amplifies fragility.
- Accept structural uncertainty rather than attempt to eliminate it.

## Module Structure
### 4.1 — Gambler’s Ruin: Why Fair Games Still Kill Players
### 4.2 — Positive Edge ≠ Safety
### 4.3 — Position Sizing as a Survival Lever (Not Optimization)
### 4.4 — Capital Decay & Irreversibility
### 4.5 — Accuracy Is a Distraction
### 4.6 — Time to Ruin Distributions
### 4.7 — Survival Probability vs Return Distribution

## Technical Structure

All simulations in this module use:

- Fixed number of traders (Monte Carlo framework)
- Fixed trade horizon
- Fractional position sizing
- Defined ruin threshold
- Identical expectancy across compared systems (when relevant)

Comparisons are controlled to isolate:

- Payoff structure differences
- Win rate differences
- Leverage sensitivity

No new probabilistic models are introduced in this module — only reconfigurations of previously defined mechanics.

---
## Analytical Themes

Throughout this module, several analytical contrasts are explored:

- Expectancy vs Survival
- Mean vs Median
- High Accuracy vs Structural Fragility
- Aggressive Growth vs Longevity
- Mathematical Edge vs Lived Experience

Each section isolates one variable while holding others constant to avoid confounding effects.

---
## Design Philosophy

This module does not attempt to:

- Optimize strategies.
- Find optimal risk fractions.
- Maximize return.

Instead, it aims to:

- Stress-test structural assumptions.
- Reveal hidden variance effects.
- Quantify extinction risk.
- Encourage risk realism.

The reader is not guided toward aggressive growth but toward understanding system durability.

---
## Expected Outcome

Upon completing Module 4, the reader should no longer evaluate systems primarily by:

- Win rate
- Average return
- Maximum upside

Instead, evaluation should prioritize:

- Survival probability
- Drawdown sensitivity
- Variance exposure
- Leverage robustness

The module concludes with a shift in orientation:

From performance optimization       
→ To structural endurance.
