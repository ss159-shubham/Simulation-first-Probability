# Module 5 — Non-Stationarity
## Overview
This module explores how randomness, variance, and structural breaks affect trading performance — even when expectancy remains constant.

The goal is to move beyond average outcomes and understand:

- Path dependency
- Regime instability
- Detection lag
- Psychological impact of variance
- Why identical edges can feel radically different

This module focuses on simulation-based intuition building rather than theory alone.

## Submodules
### 5.1 — Variance Clustering
Simulates streaks and clustered outcomes to show how randomness naturally produces apparent patterns.

#### Key Insight:
Random sequences frequently create runs and clusters that feel structural but are statistically normal.

--- 
### 5.2 — Expectancy vs Path Dependency
Demonstrates that two systems with identical expectancies can produce dramatically different equity paths.

#### Key Insight:
Average expectancy does not determine emotional experience. Path matters.

---
### 5.3 — Volatility Regime Shift
Simulates a shift from low variance to high variance while keeping the expectancy constant.

#### Tasks:
- Compare drawdowns
- Compare psychological severity
- Compare recovery time

#### Key Insight:
An identical edge under higher variance produces deeper drawdowns and greater emotional stress.

---
### 5.4 — Random Structural Break Timing
Simulates random regime shifts where the edge temporarily disappears and may revert.

#### Tasks:

- Visualize break timing
- Analyze rolling win rate
- Compare real-time ambiguity vs hindsight clarity

#### Key Insight:
Regime shifts are statistically ambiguous in real time and obvious only in hindsight.

## Core Themes of the Module

- Variance distorts perception.
- Edge detection is delayed and probabilistic.
- Performance evaluation is path-dependent.
- Structural breaks are difficult to diagnose in real time.
- Psychological severity increases with volatility, even if expectancy remains constant.

--- 
## Why This Module Matters
Traders don’t experience expectancy — they experience sequences.

Understanding variance and regime instability reduces:

- Premature system abandonment
- False confidence
- Emotional overreaction
- Misdiagnosis of edge decay

This module builds structural intuition about randomness and instability.
